First "App" completed! Goal was to practice React Class Components, setState, Image and Icons in React Native, JavaScript, and props.

The app accepts "likes" just as any social media app would. If you press the like button, the heart will turn red and the counter on top will increase. If you unlike it, the counter will decrease.

I did not add "double-click" to this; instead, if you long press the image, it will be liked.
